# `itn-dashboard` plots & tables

## Courses Tab

Within this section, do we want to have a uniform order for or rule for ordering courses when listed on the y-axis?

Has containers been added to google analytics yet?

### Plot: Visitors across Educational Resources

This plot has "Number of Visitors" on the x-axis and course names on the y-axis. Courses on the y-axis seem to be ordered from least visitors on the top to most visitors on the bottom. The bars are colored by target audience ("Leadership", "New to data", "Software developers"). Bars also have a gray label for the true number on the bar.

### Plot: Engagement by Modality

This plot as "Number of Learners" on the x-axis and course names on the y-axis. Courses on the y-axis seem to be ordered from least learners on the bottom to most visitors on the top. The bars are colored by target audience ("Leadership", "New to data", "Software developers"). Bars also have a gray label for the true number on the bar. Note this plot has a "Modality" drop down ("Website", "Leanpub", "Coursera") that updates the graph.

### Plot: Website Engagement

This plot has whatever the metric is on the x-axis (no x-axis label) and course names on the y-axis. Courses on the y-axis seem to be grouped by target audience, but not necessarily ordered in any way (even within groups). Bars are colored by target audience ("Leadership", "New to data", "Software developers"). Bars also have a gray label for the true number on the bar. Note this plot has a "Metric" drop down. ("Screen Page Views per User", "Average Session Duration", "Event Count per User", "Engagement Rate").

Possible changes/additions -- should we add definitions for these metrics? If so, where?

### Plot: Course Engagement by Target Audience

This plot has facets for the course target audience (and bars are similarly colored by this). Each facet has "Vsitors/Enrollees" on the x-axis and "Total Leanpub Enrollments", "Total Coursera Enrollments", and "Website Learners" on the y-axis. 

Data input and processing for this plot -- add notes here.

Possible changes/additions -- 
- should we simplify the y-axis labels? 
- Should we include a number of how many courses there are within each facet? 
- Since this data is true for several courses, do we want a way to see the distribution/variability rather than a summary bar?

### Plot: Total Number of Learners for each Course

This plot has "Total Learners by Course" on the x-axis and course names on the y-axis. Courses on the y-axis seem to be ordered from least learners on the top to most learners on the bottom. The bars are colored by target audience ("Leadership", "New to data", "Software developers"). Bars also have a gray label for the true number on the bar.

### Plot: Number of Coursera Enrollments by Course

This plot has "Coursera enrollments" on the x-axis and course names on the y-axis. Courses on the y-axis seem to be ordered from least learners on the top to most learners on the bottom. The bars are colored by target audience ("Leadership", "New to data", "Software developers"). Bars also have a gray label for the true number on the bar. This panel includes a note that "*Data was manually updated, and may be outdated."

Note there are two courses that don't have data shown -- is that a data input/processing problem or a graph rendering problem?

### Plot: Number of Leanpub Enrollments by Course

This plot has "Leanpub enrollments" on the x-axis and course names on the y-axis. Courses on the y-axis seem to be ordered from least learners on the top to most learners on the bottom. The bars are colored by target audience ("Leadership", "New to data", "Software developers"). Bars also have a gray label for the true number on the bar. This panel includes a note that "*Data was manually updated, and may be outdated."

### Plot: Course Popularity over Time

This plot is a scatter plot with "How long the course has been out (days)" on the x-axis and "Bookdown Views" on the y-axis. Points are colored by target audience ("Leadership", "New to data", "Software developers").

Does this plot need a total learners equivalent?

### Table: User Totals

This table lists the website and then has columns for "Active Users" and "Avg Session Duration"

Note that ocdo.fredhutch.org needs filtered out of the website.

### Table: User Engagement

This table lists the website and then has columns for "Screen Page Views per User" and "Sessions" and "Screen Page Views" and "Engagement Rate"

Note that ocdo.fredhutch.org needs filtered out of the website.

Possible changes/additions -- should we add definitions for these metrics? If so, where?

## Workshops Tab

### Workshop Recommendation Likelihood

-Move Least and Most Likely below the numbers

-Add a dashed line with label for the average rating

### Workshop Relevance

-Move Least and Most Likely below the numbers

- Add a dashed line with label for the average

- Add a footnote describing the percent of responses that rated the relevance as n 8 or higher.

### Change in confidence on workshop topic(s)

- Can we make a plot that connects the pre-post responses? I think we'll have to filter out a lot of data in case people close their slido and rejoin

### Change in confidence for specific workshops

- Make graph

### Workshop Reigstrant Career Stage

- where is data pulled from?

### Workshop Review: What did you like most?

### Workshop Recommendations for Improvement
